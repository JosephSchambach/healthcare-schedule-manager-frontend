# Healthcare Schedule Manager Frontend

Full-stack development project that simulates a hospital scheduling management system. It allows hospitals to schedule patients dynamically with specific doctors for specific diagnoses.

I am planning to also build in a predictive element for predicting patient no-shows, cancellations, and busy time-periods to help with future scheduling.

Healthcare Appointment Management System (Full-Stack)

Why: Healthcare organizations often face challenges in appointment scheduling, patient management, and cancellations. This project will help you build out the full stack—backend, frontend, API management, and security.

What I plan to learn:

    Frontend frameworks like React/Angular for user interfaces.

    Backend work with Node.js or Django.

    Integrating third-party APIs (e.g., calendar or video conferencing).

    Security best practices for healthcare data (HIPAA-compliance aspects, encryption).

    CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.

    Docker containers for the project’s microservices.

Stretch goal: Implement machine learning to predict no-shows or optimal appointment times.
